### 3️⃣ From C to Assembly

#### ✅ Step 1: Generate Assembly (.s) File

```bash
riscv-none-elf-gcc -S -O0 hai.c
```

> This creates the assembly file `hai.s` from the source file `hai.c` using no optimizations (`-O0`).

---

#### ✅ Step 2: View the Generated Assembly Code

You can open the file in a code editor like VS Code or use the terminal:

```bash
cat hai.s
```

Look inside for the `main:` label. Observe the:

* **Prologue**: instructions for setting up the stack frame (e.g., saving return address, stack pointer adjustments).
* **Epilogue**: instructions for restoring the stack and returning from the function.
