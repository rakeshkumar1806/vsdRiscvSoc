## ✅ Task 4: Hex Dump & Disassembly

### 🎯 Objective

Convert your compiled RISC-V ELF file (`hai.elf`) into:

* A **Hex file** — for hardware/simulator usage.
* A **Disassembly dump** — to inspect assembly instructions generated by the compiler.

### 🧠 Why is this important?

| Purpose        | Benefit                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔍 Disassembly | Helps understand how your C code is translated to RISC-V assembly. |
| 🧾 Hex File    | Required for programming hardware or loading code into simulators. |

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Process

#### 1️⃣ Generate Disassembly (Assembly View of `hai.elf`)

```bash
riscv-none-elf-objdump -d hai.elf > hai.dump
```

📌 **Explanation**:

* `-d` = Disassemble all code sections.
* `hai.elf` = Compiled binary.
* `hai.dump` = Output file with disassembled code.

📂 **Output File**: `hai.dump`

You can open this in VS Code or view in terminal using `cat hai.dump`.

---

#### 2️⃣ Convert ELF to Intel HEX Format

```bash
riscv-none-elf-objcopy -O ihex hai.elf hai.hex
```

📌 **Explanation**:

* `-O ihex` = Output in Intel HEX format.
* `hai.hex` = Machine code in a flashable format.

📂 **Output File**: `hai.hex`

### 🗂️ Summary Table

| File Name  | Purpose                          | Command Used                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `hai.dump` | Human-readable assembly          | `riscv-none-elf-objdump -d hai.elf` |
| `hai.hex`  | Machine code in Intel HEX format | `riscv-none-elf-objcopy -O ihex`    |

---

### 📌 Tips

* Use `cat hai.dump` or open it in VS Code to explore generated assembly.
* `hai.hex` is useful if you later want to flash your code onto a board or simulate it.

> ✅ **Conclusion**: Task 4 ensures you're not just compiling C, but understanding the machine-level output and preparing for real-world deployment.
